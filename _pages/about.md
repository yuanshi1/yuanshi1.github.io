I am a rising fifth-year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center advised by Prof. [Karen Zheng](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/yanchong/) and previously by Prof. [Joann de Zegher](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/joann-de-zegher). 

My work brings together theory, analytics, and fieldwork to tackle complex social challenges in sustainability, nonprofit operations, and healthcare. My research philosophy is grounded in choosing the right tool for the problem: depending on the context, I build theoretical models, develop data-driven decision tools, or run experiments in the field. At the core, I am passionate about understanding real-world decision-making and designing practical, scalable solutions with tangible impact. Current projects include (i) improving livelihoods and environmental outcomes in smallholder agricultural supply chains, and (ii) optimizing operations for nonprofit organizations.

Prior to MIT, I worked as a financial derivative structurer at Morgan Stanley in London. I received my Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences (Physics) from University of Cambridge and my Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. Originally from Hangzhou, China, I spent much of my teenage years in Singapore.
