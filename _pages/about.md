I am a rising fifth-year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center advised by Prof. [Karen Zheng](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/yanchong/) and previously by Prof. [Joann de Zegher](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/joann-de-zegher). 

I am passionate about leveraging data, modeling and experiments for social good, in areas including sustainability, nonprofit operations and healthcare provision. My research centers on understanding real-world decision-making and developing practical solutions with tangible impact. Some of my current research topics include:

(i) Improving livelihoods and sustainability in smallholder supply chains, and

(ii) Optimizing nonprofit operations.

Prior to MIT, I have worked as a financial derivative structurer at Morgan Stanley in London. I received my Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences from University of Cambridge and my Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. I grew up in China (Hangzhou) and Singapore.
