I am a fifth-year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center advised by Prof. [Karen Zheng](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/yanchong/) and previously by Prof. [Joann de Zegher](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/staff/directory/joann-de-zegher). 

My work brings together theory, analytics, and fieldwork to tackle complex challenges for social good. I believe in choosing the right tool for the problem: depending on the context, I build theoretical models, develop data-driven decision tools, or run experiments in the field. At the core, I’m passionate about understanding real-world decision-making and designing scalable solutions that drive meaningful impact. Current projects include (i) improving livelihoods and sustainability in smallholder supply chains, and (ii) optimizing nonprofit operations.

Prior to MIT, I worked as a financial derivative structurer at Morgan Stanley in London. I received my Bachelor's degree in Natural Sciences (Physics) from University of Cambridge and my Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. Originally from Hangzhou, China, I spent much of my teenage years in Singapore.
