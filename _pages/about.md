I am a fourth year PhD student at MIT Operations Research Center advised by Prof. [Karen Zheng](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/yanchong/) and, previously, Prof. [Joann de Zegher](https://www.jfdezegher.com/). 

I am passionate about leveraging data, modeling and experiments to address social challenges, in areas including sustainability, nonprofit operations and healthcare provision. My research centers on exploring the underlying mechanisms of relevant decision-making processes and developing innovative, practical solutions that create tangible impact in the real world. My current research agenda focuses on (i) improving livelihood and promoting sustainability in smallholder supply chains and (ii) optimizing nonprofit operations. 

Prior to MIT, I have worked as a financial derivative structurer at Morgan Stanley in London. I received my Bechelor's degree in Natural Sciences from University of Cambridge and my Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University. I grew up in China (Hangzhou) and Singapore. 

**I'm on the 2025-26 academic job market!**
