Over the course of my research journey, I’ve become increasingly drawn to the human element of OR/OM research. Immersing myself in the day-to-day lives of local communities has revealed how much lies beyond the reach of stylized models and datasets. These experiences continue to motivate me to connect abstract ideas with practical solutions that make a real difference. It’s not easy, and I’m still learning. Here, I share glimpses of that journey and hope to connect with others who are passionate about grounded, impact-driven work.
