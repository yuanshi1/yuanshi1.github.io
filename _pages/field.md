Over the course of my research journey, I’ve become increasingly drawn to the human element of OR/OM research. Immersing myself in the day-to-day lives of local communities has revealed how much lies beyond the reach of stylized models and datasets. These experiences continue to motivate me to connect abstract ideas with practical solutions that make a real difference. It’s not easy, and I’m still learning. Here, I share glimpses of that journey and hope to connect with others who are also passionate about grounded, impact-driven work.


### Field Research in Indonesia, 2023-2024 
One line of my research has focused on the context of smallholder palm fruit farmers in rural Indonesia. I have visited the field multiple times to gather contextual understanding and conduct interviews. One of my work (joint work with Karen Zheng and Iskandar Z Siregar) used behavioral experiments that directly engage smallholder farmers in controlled decision making.

### Field Research in India, 2025-present
Since 2025, I’ve been working in northern India on a pilot sutdy to encourage sustainable rice farming through a technique known as Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR). This method can significantly reduce water use, but adoption remains low despite its environmental benefits. In partnership with the World Bank Water Resource Group, our team has been designing and testing incentive schemes—simple payment structures meant to nudge farmers toward trying DSR during a critical sowing window.

### Other Engagements
Beyond academic research, I’ve been fortunate to work with mission-driven organizations committed to systems change from the ground up. At [Pempem](https://www.pempem.io/), I contributed to building digital tools for smallholder supply chains that help improve traceability and market access. I also actively volunteer at [Bridges for Enterprise](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/), where I led initiatives to measure and improve the social impact of early-stage social enterprises in the developing world.
