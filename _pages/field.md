Over the course of my research journey, I’ve become increasingly drawn to the human element of OR/OM research. Immersing myself in the day-to-day lives of local communities has revealed how much lies beyond the reach of stylized models and datasets. These experiences continue to motivate me to connect abstract ideas with practical solutions that make a real difference. It’s not easy, and I’m still learning. Here, I share glimpses of that journey and hope to connect with others who are also passionate about grounded, impact-driven work.


### Field Research in Indonesia, 2023-2024 
One line of my research has focused on the context of smallholder palm fruit farmers in rural Indonesia. I have visited the field multiple times to gather contextual understanding and conduct interviews. One of my work (joint work with Karen Zheng and Iskandar Z Siregar) used behavioral experiments that directly engage smallholder farmers in controlled decision making.

### Field Research in India, 2025-present
More recently, we started collaboration with the World Bank 2023 Water Resource Group to promote the adoption of Direct Seeding of Rice (add introduction) in Uttar Pradesh, India. The pilot field study (joint work with Karen Zheng and Alp Sungu) is currently ongoing where we conduct interviews and distribute different forms of monetary incentives to local farmers.

### Other Engagements
I have also interned as a research scientist at [Pempem](https://www.pempem.io/), a social enterprise digitizing smallholder supply chains to improve traceability, farmer livelihoods, and environmental impact. Since 2019, I have also volunteered with [Bridges for Enterprise](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/), where I led initiatives to measure and improve the social impact of sustainability-focused social enterprises.
